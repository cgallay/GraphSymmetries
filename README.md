# An empirical study of rotation equivariant neural networks

Charles Gallay, [Michaël Defferrard](http://deff.ch), [Nathanaël Perraudin](https://perraudin.info)

This work is a [semester project](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PROJETS-DE-SEMESTRE-DIRECTIVES-ENGLISH.pdf) done at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) as part of the master program of data science. 

## Goal

The goal of the project is to test different configuration in order to see the importance of being [equivariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map) to rotation for a CNN.

As a first measure, classical CNN and equivariant to rotation CNN are compare on the task of image classification and more specifically on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
